qLEET is an open-source library for exploring Loss landscape, Expressibility, Entangling capability 
and Training trajectories of noisy parameterized quantum circuits.

This project is supported by Unitary Fund.

Features
--------

Will support Qiskit’s, Cirq’s and pyQuil's quantum circuits and noise models.

Our package provides opportunities to improve existing algorithms like VQE, QAOA by utilizing intuitive 
insights from the ansatz capability and structure of loss landscape.

Facilitate research in designing new hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.
